# Reddit Video Maker Bot 🎥

All done WITHOUT video editing or asset compiling. Just pure ✨programming magic✨.


## Motivation 🤔

These videos on TikTok, YouTube and Instagram get MILLIONS of views across all platforms and require very little effort. The only original thing being done is the editing and gathering of all materials...

... but what if we can automate that process? 🤔

## Disclaimers 🚨

- This is purely for fun purposes.
- **At the moment**, this repository won't attempt to upload this content through this bot. It will give you a file that you will then have to upload manually. This is for the sake of avoiding any sort of community guideline issues.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Playwright (this should install automatically in installation)

## Installation 👩‍💻

1. Clone this repository
2. Rename `.env.template` to `.env` and replace all values with the appropriate fields. To get Reddit keys (**required**), visit [the Reddit Apps page.](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) TL;DR set up an app that is a "script". Copy your keys into the `.env` files.
3. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run `python3 main.py`
5. ...
6. Enjoy 😎
